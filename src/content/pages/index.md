        extended_description: >-
          By utilizing trained image data, this system distinguishes between
          rightfully and wrongfully rejected parts with over 98% accuracy. This
          critical identification process not only recovers valuable outputs but
          also significantly increases the overall throughput of the production
          line, reducing material waste and enhancing product quality.
